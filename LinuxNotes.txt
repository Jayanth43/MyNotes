Why to learn Linux OS ? 

======================== 

 

1) In Real-Time, all devops tools will be installed on linux machines. 

 

Ex: jenkins, docker, k8s, jfrog, nexus, sonar, ELK... 

 

2) Database servers will be instaled on Linux machines. 

 

3) Application deployment will happen in linux machine 

 

4) Application log files will be stored in linux machine 

 

 

========================= 

What is Operating System 

========================= 

 

=> OS is a software which acts as mediator between users and computers. 

 

=> Without OS we can't use any computer. 

 

=> We have several Operating systems in the market. 

 

 Ex: Windows, Unix, Linux, Mac, android, IOS etc.. 

 

============= 

Windows OS  

============= 

 

=> Developed by Microsoft Company. 

 

=> It is Licensed software. 

 

=> Single user based OS. At a time only one person can use windows Machine. 

 

=> Security is very less (anti virus s/w required) 

 

=> IT is GUI based OS. 

 

=> It is recommended for personal use. 

 

Ex: watch movies, play games, prepare docs, online classes, coding etc.... 

 

 

=========== 

Linux OS 

=========== 

 

=> Community based OS (free and open source) 

 

=> Multi User based OS. Multiple users can access single linux machine at a time. 

 

=> Security is very high. No need of anti-virus s/w. 

 

=> Linux supports both GUI and CLI. 

 

GUI - Graphical user interface 

 

CLI - Commandline interface 

 

=> Highly recommended for business systems. 

 

Ex: DB servers, App servers, DevOps tools... 

 

 

============== 

Linux History 

============== 

 

=> Linux OS developed by "Linus torvalds" in 1991. 

 

=> Linus Torvalds used 'Minux OS' to develop LInux OS. 

 

(Li)nus Torvalds + Mi(nux) =  Linux 

 

=> He released 'Linux OS' into market with free of cost.	 

 

=> Many companies downloaded 'linux os source code' and modified according to their requriement and released into market with different names those are called as Linux Distributions. 

 

Ex: Ubuntu, Red hat, Cent OS, Amazon Linux, Kali, SUSE, Fedora ... 

 

 

================== 

Environment Setup 

================== 

 

1) Create AWS Free Tier Account 

 

2) Create Linux Virtual machine in AWS cloud using EC2 service.	 

 

3) Connect with Linux VM using SSH Client software. 

 

Ex: Git Bash, MobaXterm, PuTTy, WinScp

==================== 

Linux Architecture 

==================== 

 

1) Shell 

 

2) Kernel 

 

3) Hardware components 

 

================ 

What is shell ? 

================ 

 

=> Shell is a mediator between users and kernel 

 

=> When we execute any linux command then shell will convert that command into kernel understandable format. 

 

=================== 

What is kernel ? 

=================== 

 

=> Kernel is mediator between shell and hardware components 

 

=> Kernel is core component of Linux OS. 

 

=> Kernel is responsible to convert shell given instructions into system hardware components. 

 

user/app ---> linux cmd ---> shell ---> kernel ---> linux hardware 

 

 

================== 

Linux File System 

================== 

 

=> In linux vm everything will be represented as a file only 

 

=> Linux machine entryponint is (/) root 

 

/ (root) 

 

/home 

/bin 

/etc 

/opt 

/usr 

/temp 

 

===============================================	 

 

/home : It contains users home directories 

 

Note: For every user account, one home directory will be available like below. 

 

ashok : /home/ashok/ 

 

raju : /home/raju/ 

 

anil : /home/anil/ 

 

ec2-user : /home/ec2-user/ 

 

 

/etc : It contains system related configuration files	 

 

/opt : It is used to install software packages 

 

/usr : It is used to host software applications 

 

/var : It is used to host static websites (html pages) 

 

/bin : linux machines binaries 

 

================ 

Linux Commands 

================ 

 

whoami : display currently logged in username 

 

pwd : print working directory 

 

date : display current date 

 

cal : display current month calendar 

 

cal 2050 : display 2050 year calendar 

 

===================================== 

Working with Files and Directories 

===================================== 

 

cd : change directory 

 

cd <dir-name> 

 

cd .. 

 

ls : list files		 

 

ls 

 

ls -l  : alphabetical order 

 

ls -lr  : reverse of alphabetical order 

 

ls -lt : latest files on top 

 

ls -ltr : old files on top 

 

ls -la : Display hidden files 

 

ls -l <dir-name> : print given dir content 

 

 

mkdir : To create directory 

 

mkdir java  

mkdir devops aws 

 

rmdir : To remove directory (empty directories) 

 

rmdir <dir-name> 

 

touch : To create empty files 

 

touch f1.txt 

 

touch f2.txt f3.txt f4.txt 

 

rm : To remove files and non-empty directory			 

 

rm <file-name> 

 

rm -rf <dir-name> 

 

 

cat : create new file with data + append data to existing file + print file data 

 

// create new file with data		 

$ cat > f1.txt 

 

// append data to existing file 

$ cat >> f1.txt 

 

// print file data from top to bottom 

$ cat f1.txt 

 

// print data with line nos 

$ cat -n f1.txt 

 

mv : rename files and directories + move from one location to another location 

 

// rename 

mv f1.txt f2.txt 

 

// move f2 file to devops dir 

mv f2.txt devops/		 

 

cp : copy data from one file to another file 

 

cp f1.txt f3.txt 

 

 

============= 

Text Filters 

============= 

 

head : To print first 10 lines of the file 

 

head f1.txt 

 

head -n 15 f1.txt 

 

head -n 30 f1.txt 

 

tail : To print last 10 lines of the file 

 

tail f1.txt 

 

tail -n 20 f1.txt 

 

// to watch live log msgs 

tail -f ashokit.log 

 

grep : global regular expression print 

 

=> It is used to search for keywords in the file 

 

// print lines which contains given keyword 

grep 'keyword' f1.txt 

 

// ignore case sensitive 

grep -i 'keyword' f1.txt 

 

 

# check for exceptins in last 100 lines of the file 

 

tail -n 100 ashokit.log | grep -i 'exception' 

 

============= 

Text Editors 

============= 

 

=> We will use 'vi' (visual editor) 

 

$ vi <file-name> 

 

Note: If file already available it open existing file only, if file not available it will create and open that file. 

 

=> Visual Editor works in 3 modes 

 

1) command mode (read file data) 

 

2) insert mode (press 'i' in keyword) 

 

3) esc mode (press 'esc' in keyboard) 

 

=> When we are in esc mode we can save and close the file using below options 

 

To Save changes and close file => press :wq 

 

To Ignore changes and close file => press :q!	 

 

==================== 

Networking Commands	 

==================== 

 

ifconfig : To get ip address of machine 

 

wget : To download files from internet 

 

syntax : wget <url> 

 

Ex : wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.102/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.102.zip 

 

curl : To send HTTP request to URL 

 

syntax : curl <URL> 

 

Ex : curl https://dummyjson.com/quotes/101 

 

ping : To check network connectivity 

 

================ 

User Management	 

================ 

 

-> Linux OS is a multi user based OS. 

 

-> Multiple Users can connect with one linux vm at a time. 

 

Note: When we create linux vm using "Amazon Linux" AMI we will get 'ec2-user' as a default user with sudo priviliges. 

 

SUDO : Super user doing operation 

 

 

# check users available 

cat /etc/passwd 

 

# create new user  

 

Syntax : sudo useradd <username> 

 

Ex : sudo useradd john 

 

# set password for user  

 

Syntax : sudo passwd <username> 

 

Ex : sudo passwd john 

 

 

================================ 

What is sudoers file in linux ? 

================================ 

 

Note: To give sudo priviliges for the users we need to add them in sudoers file. 

 

# open sudoers file 

$ sudo visudo 

 

Note: Configure user like below (just below root user) 

 

john    ALL=(ALL)       ALL 

 

Note: After adding user, close that file using "CTRL + X + Y + Enter" 

 

======================================================== 

How to enable password based authentication in linux ? 

======================================================== 

 

=> In Linux VM by default PasswordAuthentication is disabled. 

 

=> If we want to connect with Linux vm using  username and password we need to enable that. 

 

Note: We will enable that in SSHD config file. 

 

# open sshd_config file 

sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config 

 

Note : In that file find PasswordAuthentication property. Its default value is no, change to yes. 

 

Note: After changing, save that file and close it by using :wq + Enter 

 

# restart sshd service  

sudo service sshd restart 

 

# exit from the machine  

exit 

 

# execute ssh command 

ssh username@public-ip 

 

================== 

File Permissions  

================== 

 

=> File permissions are divided into 3 types  

 

a) read (r) 

 

b) write (w) 

 

c) execute (x) 

 

=> File permissions will be represented like below 

 

ex :  

-rwxrwxrwx f1.txt 

drwxrwxrwx java 

 

=> File permissions containts total 9 characters 

 

=> First 3 characters will represent owner permissions (the user who created that file) 

 

=> Middle 3 characters will represent group permissions. 

 

=> Last 3 characters will represent other users permissions. 

 

u ---> user (owner) 

 

g ---> group 

 

o ---> others 

 

Ex: 

 

rw-rw-r-x  f1.txt 

 

user : read + write 

 

group : read + write 

 

others : read + execute 

 

rwx------ f2.txt  

 

owner : read + write + execute  

group : Nothing 

Others: Nothing 

 

 

=> To add or remove file permissions we will use 'chmod' command. 

 

+   ===> To add 

 

-   ===> To remove 

 

# add execute permission for user(owner) 

chmod u+x f1.txt 

 

# remove write permission for user(owner) 

chmod u-w f1.txt 

 

# add write and execute permissions for group 

chmod g+wx f1.txt 

 

# remove read permission for others 

chmod o-r f1.txt 

 

 

=> We can represent file permissions using numeric numbers also. 

 

 

0 ==> No permission 

 

1 ==> Execute 

 

2 ==> Write 

 

3 ==> (2 + 1) => Write + Execute 

 

4 ==> Read 

 

5 ==> (4 + 1) => Read + Execute 

 

6 ==> (4 + 2) => Read + Write 

 

7 ==> (4 + 2 + 1) => Read + Write + Execute 

 

# ugo + x 

chmod 111 f1.txt 

 

# u+x  g+w o+wx 

chmod 123 f1.txt 

 

# u+r g+rx o+rw 

chmod 456 f1.txt 

 

# ugo + rwx 

chmod 777 f1.txt 

 

# u-rwx g-rwx o+rwx  

chmod 7 f1.txt 

 

====================================== 

How to change ownership of the file ? 

====================================== 

 

=> using chown command we can change ownership  

 

$ sudo chown ashok f1.txt 

 

 

============================================= 

How to find the location of files in linux ? 

============================================= 

 

=> in linux we can use 'find' command to search file paths. 

 

# search for the files which are having name as f1.txt 

sudo find /home -name f1.txt 

 

# search for empty files inside /home 

sudo find /home -type f -empty 

 

# search for empty directories inside /home 

sudo find /home -type d -empty 

 

===================== 

process management 

===================== 

 

Process management in Linux involves controlling and monitoring the execution of programs (processes) on the system.  

 

# display processing running with PID 

$ ps aux 

 

Note: Every process will have process id (PID). 

 

# kill process 

kill <PID> 

 

# terminate process immediatley (forcefully) 

kill -9 <PID> 

 

============================================= 

How to change hostname in vm (temporarly) ? 

============================================= 

 

# set hostname 

$ sudo hostname <new-name> 

 

# re-start session  

$ exit  

 

Note: connect back to vm then we can see configured hostname 

 

 

================== 

Package Managers 

================== 

 

Package : A software  

 

=> Package managers are used to manage softwares installation in linux machines. 

 

=> Package Managers and Package Names are specific to linux distribution. 

 

Amazon linux + Red hat + Cent os :: yum is package manager 

 

Ubuntu + Debian :: apt is package manager 

 

# install git client software 

 

sudo yum install git -y 

git --version 

whereis git 

 

 

# install maven 

 

sudo yum install maven -y 

mvn -version 

whereis mvn 

 

# install java latest version  

 

sudo yum install java -y 

java -version 

whereis java 

 

# install java 17v  

sudo yum install -y java-17-amazon-corretto-devel 

 

# install java 11v  

sudo yum install -y java-11-amazon-corretto-devel 

 

# Switch Between Multiple Java Versions 

sudo alternatives --config java 

 

 

============================= 

Webserver Setup in Linux VM 

============================= 

 

=> Webserver is a software which is used to run websites / web applications. 

 

=> Website means collection of web pages. 

 

ex: login page, register page, contact us page, about us page.. 

 

=> Websites are divided into 2 types 

 

1) static website 

 

2) dynamic website 

 

=> The website which gives same response for every user is called as static website. 

 

ex: news websites (www.eenadu.com, www.timesofindia.com) 

 

=> The website which gives response based on logged in user is called as dynamic website. 

 

Ex : www.gmail.com 

 

=> To run static websites we can use 'httpd' as webserver. 

 

=> To run dynamic websites we can use 'tomcat, jboss, weblogic as webservers. 

 

 

# install httpd webserver 

sudo yum install httpd -y 

 

# check httpd status 

sudo service httpd status 

 

# start httpd server 

sudo service httpd start 

 

Note: httpd webserver runs on http protocol with 80 port number. 

 

Note: To access our webserver we need to enable http protocol in Ec2 vm security group inbound rules. 

 

=> We can access our webserver using ec2-vm public ip. 

 

# Navigate to website content directory 

$ cd /var/www/html 

 

# create index.html file with website content 

$ sudo vi index.html 

 

=> We can access our webserver using ec2-vm public ip.
